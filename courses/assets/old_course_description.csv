develop the basic research skills in data-gathering and data analysis;
and (3) develop students’ ability to read applied linguistic research
critically."
ENG2063,"This course seeks to examine a wide variety
of literature for and about children. It hopes to encourage students
to identify and articulate currents of thought in the texts they
encounter, to explore the manner of the expression, and to make
comparisons where appropriate. Finally, and to a limited degree, the
course also endeavours to locate its study within an educational
context, regarding literature not only as literature but as a medium
of instruction as well."
ENG2093,"The short story offers a basic introduction to
this important genre of literature. Students focus on the critical
evaluation of representative short stories by diverse authors from
around the world. In doing so, students will be encouraged to
identify and articulate currents of thought in the texts they
encounter, to explore the manner of the expression, and to make
comparisons where appropriate. The course will proceed
chronologically and examine precursors of short fiction and then the
development of modern and postmodern writing."

how meaning is related to linguistic form and how it is conveyed in
context, and to equip students with the discourse-analytic tools and
skills for studying how language, both spoken and written, enacts
social and cultural perspectives and identities."
ENG2123,"This course aims: (1) for students to become
familiar with and be able to use the different kinds of corpora
currently available; (2) for students to create their own corpora
using available software; (3) for students to analyse data using

in story-telling and narration that are necessary to convey adventure
and sensory impressions while expressing a well-informed respect
for the subject of their stories."
ENG3073,"This course explores the interactive
relationship between language and society. It aims to make the
students aware that a second language cannot be learned effectively
if the learning is separated from the social background of the target
language. Though learning about the vocabulary and grammar of a
language without learning anything at all about its society is in
principle possible, social questions are harder to ignore as soon as
one starts to consider the language as an object of research. The
course focuses on the societal influence on language use and the
changes in language structure, with a focus on the English language."
ENG3083,"The course aims to (1) demonstrate
connections among language and culture, social life, political

language poetry written anywhere in the world as well as some
poetry in translation."
ENG3103,"This course is designed to introduce the
students to a number of fictional or non-fiction works in English
produced by the Asian Diaspora in the West. Through these works,
the students will examine the patterns of human movements and the
impacts of the two worlds, the world of their origin and that of their

and transhumanism, in order to build upon existing critical
knowledge and further understanding of and engagement with
contemporary critical discourse."
ENG3223,"This course is intended to guide students to
read and interpret literature from a cross-cultural perspective.
Students will be expected to read works from both Chinese and
Western literary traditions. Readings will be organized around either
thematic topics such as literary journeys, death, and romantic love
or literary genres such as lyric poetry, Bildungsroman, and ghost
stories. Chinese texts will be read in English translations and
problems of translation will be addressed when necessary. Students’
performance will be measured through class discussions, group
presentations, writing assignments, and a final exam."
ENG4013,"This course will focus on a single prominent
fiction writer, dramatist, or poet, presenting the work in the author's
biographical, historical, and critical contexts. Readings will include
a representative selection of the author's works plus secondary
critical and historical materials as appropriate to the author chosen."
ENG4023,"This is a focused examination of one
particular genre and its attendant sub-genres. For example, these
genres could include magic realism, detective fiction, science
fiction, Theatre of the Absurd, or historical fiction. Students are
required to consider the various ways that texts can be understood in

which introduces to students a comprehensive review of the field of
political science. Basic concepts, political theories and
methodologies, political institutions, political parties are all
examined. The subfields of comparative politics and international
relations are also integral parts of this course so as to lay down the
foundation for further studies. Political developments in Europe,
America and Asia are frequently employed as examples to the
introduction of political ideas."
POLS1013,"This course intends to familiarize Year 1 GIR
students with basic concepts of world geography - and in particular
human geography - which are essential for them to better make
sense of the transnational socio-political and economic dynamics
assessed in Year 2-Year 4 major courses. The course will introduce

population, migration, linguistic and religious identities, nations,
states, socio-economic development."
POLS2013,"This is a second-year, first-semester course
which introduces students to the basic concepts, methods and
processes of International Relations by focusing on four major
“perspectives” that have framed analytical work in the field, namely
“Realism-Power Politics”, “Dominance-Dependence”,
Transnationalism-Interdependency” and “Cultural Interactionism”.
International Relations seek to build upon and integrate the
disciplinary foundations students obtained in their first-year
Political Science and Political Economy subjects."
POLS2023,"Political economy, with its roots in the
European 17th and 18th centuries, was the forebear of what
developed in the twentieth century into the two separate disciplines
of political science and economics. However, it has become defined
in the last twenty years as that sub-discipline of political science and
economics which examines the relationship of the individual to
society, the economy, and the state with a particular focus on
state-market interactions and intersections. It is the study of
relations and choices, of structures and institutions, of scales from
the personal and local to the national, international, and global. Its
originators include John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Adam Smith, Karl
Marx, and Max Weber. Including choice theory and market theory,
system theory, development theory and public policy theory,
contemporary political economy examines the historic and human
behavioural linkages among values/morals, politics, economic
reality and economic reasoning. Its prime question concerns the role
of politics in the economy and the effects and constraints of the
economy on the power and functions of politics and of the state."
POLS2033,"This course is designed to enhance students’
ability to perceive, evaluate and understand political and social
phenomena through a systematic introduction to a wide range of
approaches, methods and theories of political science. Basic

political development of Europe, America, Asia and other regions
with the help of particular perspectives and research methods."
POLS3013,"This course is designed to provide
Government and International Studies majors with knowledge of
Chinese foreign policies during the Cold War and Post-Cold War
era. Being a socialist country with a strong nationalistic posture,
how China situates herself in the world arena, and shifts her foreign
policies from pro-Soviet stance (1950s) to isolation (1960s) then
opening up to the West (1970s), will be thoroughly examined. The
efforts of constructing a “Chinese Theory of International
Relations” by the Chinese policy analysts will also be studied."
POLS3203,"The course aims at familiarising students with
key principles of sustainable development governance. The
adoption of the “Sustainable Development Goals” (hereinafter,
SDGs) by the UN in September 2015 has officially highlighted the
urgent need for a paradigmatic shift towards holistic development
governance that may deliver comprehensive solutions to the
increasingly interconnected challenges of socio-economic progress.

while advice may be sought by the student and given by the Adviser,
the main responsibility for topic selection remains with the student."
POLS3033,"As the world grows more integrated, as
communication and business speed up the changes in our daily lives,
the impact of events on our lifestyles deepens, and the necessity to
understand and react intelligently to events and forces affecting us
becomes more imperative. Lectures are used to inform and provoke
students to apply concepts and data acquired in their time of study
to current problems facing the global order, and thus, to themselves,
their families, and their careers and regimes which play such a vital
role in today’s world."
POLS3163,"The course aims at assessing the
contemporary relations between Asia and Europe. It analyses the
regions’ internal and external dynamics, including European
colonial rule and its legacy, the evolution of interregional relations
“as equals”, and the current intense politico-economic
interdependence."

with issues relating to climate change and natural resource
governance in a post-COP21 (2015 Paris Conference) world.
Students shall not only analyse the most relevant environmental
challenges at national, regional and global levels, but will also
assess latest policies outputs and outcomes, as well as related
market opportunities, thus analysing both public and private sector
responses to the steep challenge of optimising human activities –
such as energy consumption, waste disposal and food production -
on a finite planet."
POLS3273,"As economic growth remains crucial to
socio-economic progress, both national and international institutions
are expected to devise, support and implement conducive
capacity-building policies that, in an ever-changing age of
knowledge economy, may not only prove to be “quantitatively”
successful, but also mindful of the quality and sustainability of the
very progress they deliver. The course will explore a selection of
case studies from across the globe to highlight the connection
between governments’ politico-economic strategies, economic
growth and innovative entrepreneurship as crucial ingredients for
lasting progress. Particular attention will be reserved to Chinese
cases, so as to reflect the country’s ongoing transition towards a
more sustainable, high-value, knowledge-based development model;
the course content will also include the study of “Research,
Development, Demonstration and Deployment” (RDDD) patterns
and policies, and the analysis of “innovation ecosystems” in both
Asia and the Americas."
POLS3283,"In the wake of the new millennium, Africa is
increasingly dubbed as a land of hope and opportunities: its vibrant
young population, unique wealth of natural resources, deepening
international ties with emerging superpowers – i.e. China, above all
- are finally making it conceivable for the continent to overcome
“traditional” problems such as deep poverty and conflict. The
course’s main aims are familiarising students with Africa’s human
and physical geography, as well as stressing the close
interdependence of social, environmental and economic factors. The
course shall focus in particular on the analysis of a selection of
Sub-Saharan development patterns that will encompass success
stories, persisting challenges and market opportunities of both
regional and global relevance. They will include East Africa’s fast

evolution of European integration and then looks analytically at the
institutions and the policies of the European Union, assessing their
effectiveness and investigating their implications for the rest of the
world. It provides a focused examination of the political economy
of European integration, highlighting the dynamic relationship
between economic and political integration and the respective roles
of the state, market and EU institutions. Moreover, it highlights the

Constitution prepared by the European Convention in June 2003. It
also provides a critical review of the main theoretical contributions
to the debate on European integration, and explores the prospects
for eastwards enlargement in the post-Communist period."
EURO3013,"This course examines the Central European
states of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia in
historical and comparative context. It begins with a discussion of
the nature and weaknesses of the Communist regimes of Eastern
Europe and the causes and processes of the 1989 upheavals in the
region. It then considers the paradoxes and obstacles in the course
of post-Communist transition to democracy, the market economy
and the civil society. The key issues of democratic consolidation
and pro-market transformation will be addressed."

POLS3323,"The course is designed for the discussion of a
range of contemporary issues in the governance and society of
modern Latin America, including the studies on cultural, social, and
economic development for the countries in the region. Beginning in
1492, its conquest by the Spanish and Portuguese created a totally
new social order based on domination, hierarchy, and the
intermingling of European, African, and indigenous elements. After
World War II, more analysts worked on describing Latin American
economic growth and cultural traditions originated from their
Spanish and Portuguese heritage. This course is designed
deliberately to accommodate to the discretion and expertise of the
instructor concerned, which would lead students to think and
understand Latin American governance and society in a
broad-gauge approach."

theoretical, analytical tools, which may enable them to understand
politics across a broad range of countries and to assess alternative
interpretations of political phenomena."
POLS3003,"The course introduces students to the origins
and development of international law and its role in the conduct of
international relations. Specific topics include the sources and
subjects of international law, international agreements, the
importance of international institutions such as international courts
and organisations, diplomacy, and the settlement of international
disputes."
POLS3093,"Increasingly over the last 130 years,
nation-states have agreed to found, fund, and join international
organisations whose task is to oversee and organise the myriad
global interactions which have increasingly become a part of daily
life. As the actions of people and governments in one place
increasingly affect the lives of people and the prerogatives and
responsibilities of government in others, nation-states have ceded
portions of their day to day sovereignty to international agencies
and actors. Today, international organisations exercise
globe-girdling responsibilities in areas that affect the daily life of
nearly everyone. From transport to environmental pollution, from
drug smuggling to AIDS, international organisations play a vital
part in protecting life and imparting order to international
intercourse. This course examines these international organisations
and regimes which play such a vital role in today’s world."
POLS3143,"This course is conceived as an introduction to
the study of political theory through the analysis of the thought of

the role of intelligence agencies, and such. In looking in-depth at
such issues the students should not only understand general security
concerns of nations’, but also how governments work to insure their
national security."
POLS3223,"This course intends to look at the influence of
British “Westminster” tradition on the global political systems. It
begins with an examination of medieval English history of England
which set the shape of the parliamentary model being followed in
many countries of the world today. It also attempts to examine the
origin of democracy in the “Westminster” system, and its extend to
its application among the Commonwealth of Nations. Finally, it also
reveals the bonds and the quarrels which Commonwealth countries
had over the course of the Post-World War II period."
POLS3233,"This course will allow students to earn college
credits for time spent working in the field with NGOs, research
institutes, government organizations, media, publishing houses, or
the private sector. Since some internships are very demanding of
